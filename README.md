### Format isnt quite ready for you to use yet.

The first official release of Format will include all the functionality of [JsFormat](https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat),
plus HTML formatting (maybe more, we will see how it goes). Format dynamically decides which formatter to use based off of
the file extension, falling back to the active syntax.

I won't push to this repo if the plugin is in an obviously broken state. Feel free to test it out. However, the keybinding will conflict with JsFormat.
